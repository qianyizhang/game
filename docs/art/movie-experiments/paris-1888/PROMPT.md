Build a single self-contained three.js HTML page that renders a 14-second animation (1280x720, 30fps, deterministic: expose window.renderAt(t) so every frame can be captured).

Scene: a floating voxel diorama island - Paris, 1888, the Eiffel Tower under construction. Everything is already moving on frame 1.

Island:
- floating chunk with layered rock underside, the Seine curving across the front with stone quays and an arched bridge
- Champ de Mars: dirt work yard, stacks of iron girders, wooden sheds, a steam engine with a smoking chimney
- around it: rows of Haussmann buildings with cream walls, grey zinc roofs, chimneys, tiny trees along the boulevards
The tower (the hero):
- dark reddish-brown wrought iron lattice made of thin voxel beams with real X-bracing, not solid blocks
- four curved legs and the first platform finished, the second level half built, the top section only a skeleton
- wooden scaffolding towers under the legs, small creeper cranes on the structure lifting girders on chains
- glowing orange rivet sparks where workers hammer, small puffs of steam
Life (hundreds of tiny voxel people, ~3 voxels tall):
- riveting teams on every level with hammers swinging, workers walking along beams
- girders hoisted by cranes swinging slowly into place
- horse-drawn carts carrying iron across the yard, crowds of onlookers in 1880s clothes with top hats and parasols
- a riverboat with a smoking funnel moving along the Seine, carriages crossing the bridge, pigeons circling the tower
Camera and look:
- wide view of the whole island, slow orbit (~25 degrees) with a gentle push-in toward the tower
- warm late-afternoon sun, soft shadows, ambient occlusion, light haze, rounded voxels, ACES tone mapping, soft bloom on sparks
